paid website for radix company

My very first html paid project in late early 2018. 
For this project i did html markup along with some simply modal windows logic and slider menus. Code has many flaws yet it's good if you take into the account it's made by
the very young and green developer. 

Written in pure HTML with BEM-naming and modal windows. 
I used gulp for this project for first time.
